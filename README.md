I am Naveen, a Product manager, growth hacker, and experimental learner
ðŸ’œ I love solving complex problems and experimenting with innovative ideas.

ðŸ’» I'm a tech enthusiast who enjoys creating revolutionary products that make people's lives easier.

ðŸŒ± Nature is my sanctuary, and I believe in disconnecting from technology to find solace and rejuvenation.

ðŸ“š Reading and experimenting with new concepts is a passion of mine, and I explore a variety of topics to gain new perspectives. I am currently reading Sapiens (Graphic Novel).

ðŸŒŸ I live by Tolkien's words, "It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life"
